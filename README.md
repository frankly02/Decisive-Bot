# Decisive-Bot
A Discord Bot that stores a list of options, and makes random choices on command.

main.py contains the main source code that allows the bot to execute its services. It uses Python and Discord API to execute its functions given an event call in the bot's Discord server. run.py uses Threading and Flask to keep the bot running with intervalled pings from UptimeRobot.
